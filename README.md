FODMAP food search application
My wife was diagnosed with IBS and put on the low FODMAP diet. It worked wonders and she feels great (winning...). Searching low/high foods took time and grocery shopping became a daunting task (losing...). So we created this tool. It's a work in progress but should save you hours (literally) searching Google in the middle of the store isle.
